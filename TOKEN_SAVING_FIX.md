# Token Saving Fix - Critical Issue Resolved

## The Problem

After completing OAuth authentication successfully:
1. ✅ User granted permissions
2. ✅ Google redirected back with token in URL
3. ❌ Token was extracted but **NOT saved to storage**
4. ❌ Service instance didn't have the token
5. ❌ `fetchSteps()` failed with "Google Fit not authorized"

## Root Cause

The `checkUrlForToken()` method only **extracted** the token from URL but didn't:
- Save it to localStorage
- Update the service instance's `accessToken` property
- Set `isAuthorized` flag

So even though the token was present, the service thought it wasn't authorized.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added `setAccessToken()` Method
```typescript
// In GoogleFitService.ts
setAccessToken(token: string): void {
  this.accessToken = token;
  this.isAuthorized = true;
  console.log('Access token set, service is now authorized');
}
```

### 2. Save Token in OAuth Callback
```typescript
// In GoogleFitCard.tsx - when token is detected
if (urlToken) {
  // Save to localStorage
  localStorage.setItem('google_fit_token', urlToken);
  
  // Update service instance
  googleFitService.setAccessToken(urlToken);
  
  // Now fetchSteps() will work!
  await fetchSteps();
}
```

### 3. Reload Token in Message Handler
```typescript
// When original tab receives success message
if (event.data.type === 'GOOGLE_FIT_AUTH_SUCCESS') {
  // Reload token from storage (saved by other tab)
  const storedToken = localStorage.getItem('google_fit_token');
  if (storedToken) {
    googleFitService.setAccessToken(storedToken);
  }
  
  await fetchSteps(); // Now this works!
}
```

### 4. Popup Blocker Fallback
```typescript
// Try new tab first
const newWindow = window.open(authUrl, '_blank');

// If blocked, fall back to same-window redirect
if (!newWindow || newWindow.closed) {
  console.warn('Popup blocked, falling back to same-window redirect');
  window.location.href = authUrl;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Popup Allowed (Best UX)

1. Click "Connect Google Fit"
2. New tab opens with Google login
3. Complete authentication
4. New tab: Token saved to localStorage + service updated
5. New tab: Sends message to original tab
6. New tab: Closes automatically
7. Original tab: Receives message
8. Original tab: Loads token from localStorage
9. Original tab: Updates service instance
10. Original tab: Fetches steps successfully ✅

### Scenario 2: Popup Blocked (Fallback)

1. Click "Connect Google Fit"
2. Popup blocked → Same window redirects to Google
3. Complete authentication
4. Google redirects back to app
5. App detects token in URL
6. Token saved to localStorage + service updated
7. Fetches steps successfully ✅

## Testing Checklist

After restarting the server:

### Test 1: With Popups Allowed
- [ ] Click "Connect Google Fit"
- [ ] New tab opens
- [ ] Complete authentication
- [ ] New tab closes
- [ ] Original tab shows success
- [ ] Steps appear (no "not authorized" error)

### Test 2: With Popups Blocked
- [ ] Block popups in browser
- [ ] Click "Connect Google Fit"
- [ ] Same window redirects to Google
- [ ] Complete authentication
- [ ] Redirects back to app
- [ ] Steps appear (no "not authorized" error)

### Test 3: Token Persistence
- [ ] Connect successfully
- [ ] Refresh the page
- [ ] Should still be connected
- [ ] Steps should load without re-authentication

## Console Logs (Success)

You should now see:
```
OAuth callback detected, token received: ya29.a0AfB_byD...
Access token set, service is now authorized
Fetching steps from Google Fit...
Fetching steps: {start: "2025-10-12T00:00:00.000Z", end: "2025-10-12T12:57:26.000Z", hasToken: true}
API Response Status: 200
API Response Data: {...}
Steps from derived:com.google.step_count.delta:...: 1234
Total steps calculated: 1234
```

## What You Should NOT See Anymore

❌ "Error fetching steps: Google Fit not authorized"
❌ "Error: Popup blocked. Please allow popups..."
❌ Token extracted but steps fail to load
❌ Need to reconnect after every page refresh

## Key Changes Summary

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `GoogleFitService.ts` | Added `setAccessToken()` | Allow manual token setting |
| `GoogleFitService.ts` | Popup blocker fallback | Handle blocked popups gracefully |
| `GoogleFitCard.tsx` | Save token in callback | Persist token to storage |
| `GoogleFitCard.tsx` | Update service instance | Make token available to API calls |
| `GoogleFitCard.tsx` | Reload token in message handler | Sync token across tabs |

## Why This Matters

Without saving the token:
- Every API call fails with "not authorized"
- User has to reconnect constantly
- OAuth flow appears broken even when successful

With token saving:
- ✅ API calls work immediately after auth
- ✅ Token persists across page refreshes
- ✅ Seamless user experience
- ✅ Both tabs stay in sync

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your dev server**
2. **Clear browser storage** (to start fresh)
3. **Test the flow end-to-end**
4. **Verify steps load without errors**

The "Google Fit not authorized" error should now be completely resolved!
